# CS-210-Module-8-Journal

In this project I created a code to calculate yearly interest by receiving information from the user and using that to callculate intests in the amount 
of time given from the user.

What did you do particularly well?
  I try to manage spacing and indention well to make a easy to read program.
 
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  I should have introduced more comments to better explain the code and plan of my functions

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  The most complicated part of the project was setting the interest to continue until the amount of years that were entered by the user.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  This project taught me how to transfer data across files and create a cleaner more eligble code.
  
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I used whitespace and a naming scheme to easily be able to follow the order of operation across multiple files.
